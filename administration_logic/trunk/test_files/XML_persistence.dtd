<!-- Each <type> element names a user profile type that is assigned to the user
  -  profile in which this this element appears.  At this version, the type
  -  element provides ony the relevant user profile type name (which is supposed
  -  to be a unique identifier, per the User Profile component).  Future
  -  versions might include some mechanism for recording profile type parameters
  -  in this element's body, but at this version its body is defined to be empty

<!-- Each <name> element represents the name of the user profile property in
