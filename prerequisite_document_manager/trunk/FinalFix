1. for using fetch = FetchType.EAGER, tried out that way, but failed. I even can not deploy the ear properly with that way. please reconsider it.
And I think reviewer is wrong. even they can be fetched, there will be strange thing as I said in forum. Please consider it.
2. shallow copy is used, instead of 
-------------------------
if (this.documentVersions != documentVersions) {
            this.documentVersions.clear();
            this.documentVersions.addAll(documentVersions);
        }
-------------------------

I think it is more elegant.
3. for documenting cascading operation, I think put in class doc would be more appreiate.
