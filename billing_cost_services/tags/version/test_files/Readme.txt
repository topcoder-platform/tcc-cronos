Dear Reviewer,

BillingCostDataServiceImpl
This class's main code is finished, because the designer do not show a clear logic.
And I the correct query txt so late and so complex, so designer allowed to fix it in FF.
see http://apps.topcoder.com/forums/?module=Thread&threadID=721197&start=0

Thanx
Happy Reviewing.

I leave the code with '//', maybe it can give some info to other developers.
