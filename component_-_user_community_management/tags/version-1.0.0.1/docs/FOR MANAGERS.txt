I recommend to update tc_card.swf that displays TopCoder member cards.
Currently this SWF displays algorithm, design and development ratings only.
The data feed for this SWF is generated by this component.
And as an enhancement I extended this XML data feed so that it additionally contains all other member ratings under the following XML elements:
- highSchoolRating
- marathonRating
- conceptualizationRating
- specificationRating
- architectureRating
- assemblyRating
- testSuitesRating
- testScenariosRating
- uiPrototypeRating
- riaBuildRating

Such update can be performed via a Studio competition.
