1. Existing JSPs can be reused with small changes. JSPs can be found here:
https://coder.topcoder.com/internal/web_module/trunk/src/main/com/topcoder/web/tc/view/card
https://coder.topcoder.com/internal/web_module/trunk/src/main/com/topcoder/web/tc/view/my_home/referrals.jsp

The following Struts tag can be used in JSP to insert user ID:
    <s:property value="userId" />

The following Struts tag can be used in JSP to insert user handle:
    <s:property value="userHandle" />

2. ShowCardDescriptionAction corresponds to the following page:
http://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=Static&d1=card&d2=description

Additional required changes to JSPs:

1) referrals.jsp should iterate over "referrals" property. Each element is a ReferralData instance with "coderId", "rating", "handle" and "memberSince" properties.

2) additionally a referral link should be added to referrals.jsp. E.g.:

       Please send the following link to invite friends to TopCoder:<br />
       <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/reg/?ref=<s:property value="userHandle" />">
         http://www.topcoder.com/reg/?ref=<s:property value="userHandle" />
       </a>


2. tc_card.swf also needs to be updated to use new data feed path and "coderId" as parameter. Otherwise TopCoder member cards won't be displayed.
