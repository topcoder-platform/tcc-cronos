1. Here are basic sequence to test the component:

- Correct "jboss_home" and "jboss_config_name" in build-dependencies.xml.

- Ensure that all jars listed in build-dependencies.xml are present.

- Run "ant deployEAR" target.

- Start JBoss (I used 4.2.2.GA)

- Run "ant test" or "ant coveragereport".

PLEASE NOTE: Cobertura 1.8 uses older log4j than JBoss does.
To correctly test and cover the submission you should replace cobertura's log4j jar with log4j-1.2.15.jar. You can find it in /test_files



2. JBoss can't correctly deploy EJBs due to the annotations provided in the design.
Since without designer's confirmation we aren't allowed to make design changes, it seems this issue will left on final fixes.

Because of that client's getPort() methods couldn't be properly tested.
However, this issue doesn't affects overall component functionality since beans are properly tested.



3. Changes in the CS are marked with the red color.
