Hello reviewer:
   +) To run my test, you should set your environment first.
   Please add folder test_files into your class path.

   *) Change the config about database to suit your environment.
      These files need be updated: ApplicationContext.xml

   +) Then use createDB.sql to create tables

   +) Then use insert.sql to insert data for tests

   +) Use the ant deploy_to_tomcat to see demo

   +) After testing, use delete.sql to delete all data

   OK, That's all. Have a nice day!
