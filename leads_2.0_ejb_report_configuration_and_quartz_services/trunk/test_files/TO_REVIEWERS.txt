############# COMPILE ##############

It depends on several components(including tcs and third-party).
I provided the reflib, contains all the dependencies. 

besides the reflib, you also need:
j2ee.jar
openjpa-1.2.1.jar

They are two large to submit(sorry), but easy to download.

And the build-dependencies.xml is also presented.

I hope they may help you.


############# RUN TESTS #############

The dependencies(jar packages) for running test cases are also provided in reflib. 

Then:
1). Start your db2, and execute the statement provided in test_files/schema.dll.
2). Changes the configurations in test_files/WEB-INF/persistence.xml, please modifies to your own database or user/password.
3). Run the test cases.
4). The test cases may take about several minutes, drink a cup of coffee while waiting.


############# OTHER TIPS ###############

Something that may be mistake by the designer and I corrected:

1. Documentation: ReportService#getOrganizationRollupReport & ReportServiceBean#getOrganizationRollupReport:
   given manager CNUM and filter manager logon id ---> filter manager Cnum.

2. the field document ReportServiceBean#submittedStatusName in not started by a verb, I changed to be "Represents ...".
   And also in the method: searchEmployees

3. the documentation in class "ReportSortingComparator<T>" should change to "Comparator&lt;T&gt".

4. All the exception in TogglePipelineIdentificationCycleDaemon class should be TogglePipelineIdentificationCycleDaemonException.

5. TogglePipelineIdentificationCycleDaemon the job name and trigger name must be set.

6. when lookup a jndi, you check the class cast exception.

7. We should shut down the scheduler in unit tests.

8. in ReportServiceBean#createReport, the divider could be 0, we should handle this.

9. code redundancy: ReportServiceBean#getOrganizationRollupReport can reuse the code in getOrganizationNineBoxReport. etc
   and same in summary report
   
10. getOrganizationNineBoxReport, should check "dto.getEmployee().getMatrixManagerCNUM()" whether it is null,
    If it is null, we should remove the related employee
    according to: http://forums.topcoder.com/?module=Thread&threadID=689307&start=0
    
 11. in getPipelineCycleStatus, we should check the PipelineCycleStatus status = Enum.valueOf(..) whether it is valid.
     and also in the Daemon class.

12. The usage of the main classes are ducumented.

13. The changes in CS are highlighted

14. The name of "logger" in daemon class should be "LOGGER"
