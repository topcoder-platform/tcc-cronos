/**
 * <p>
 * This represents the interface that defines all business methods for project data retrieval
 * services. It will provide streamlined access to project information. It will allow for a simple
 * search for full or basic project information, or to use custom search criteria to locate
 * projects, either in its full or basic form. The basic form involves getting the
 * <code>Project</code> object (from <b>Project Management</b>), and the full form involves the
 * <code>FullProjectData</code> object, which not only provides information as the basic form, but
 * also provides project phase information, all resources participating in the project, and all
 * teams currently existing in it. Furthermore, it provides data about the technologies involved in
 * this project (such as Java, C#).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Modifications in version 1.1:
 * <ul>
 * <li>In version 1.0, it has one implementation: <code>ProjectServicesImpl</code>. In version
 * 1.1, it is added an EJB layer to wrap all calls of the ProjectServices interface, so it has two
 * implementations: <code>ProjectServicesImpl</code> and <code>ProjectServicesBean</code> since
 * version 1.1.</li>
 * <li>In version 1.1, <code>createProject</code> and <code>updateProject</code> methods are
 * added</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Module Contest Service Software Contest Sales Assembly change: new methods added to support creating/updating/query contest
 * sale for software contest.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Updated for Cockpit Project Admin Release Assembly v1.0: new methods added to support retrieval of project and their permissions.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Version 1.1.1 (Cockpit Pipeline Release Assembly 1 v1.0) Change Notes:
 *  - Introduced method to retrieve SimplePipelineData for given date range.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Version 1.2 (Cockpit Pipeline Release Assembly 2 - Capacity) changelog:
 *     - added service that retrieves a list of capacity data (date, number of scheduled contests) starting from
 *       tomorrow for a given contest type
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Changes in v1.2.1 - Cockpit Release Assembly 11
 * Add method getDesignComponents to get design components.
 * </p>

 * <p>
 * <strong>Thread Safety:</strong> Implementations must be thread-safe from the point of view of
 * their use. Implementations can assume that passed objects will be operated on by just one thread.
