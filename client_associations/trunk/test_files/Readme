Dear Reviewer, 

I have the following things to clarify.

1. some checkstyle problems is raised by auto-generated class. I should not change it. like 

F:\Download\Client_Associations_1.0_dev_dist\src\java\main\com\topcoder\controlpanel\clientassociations\dao\hibernate\CompClient.java:27:26: warning: Name 'comp_id' must match pattern '^[a-z][a-zA-Z0-9]*$'

2. see http://www.hibernate.org/hib_docs/reference/en/html/session-configuration.html, "For use inside an application server, you should almost always configure Hibernate to obtain connections from an application server Datasource registered in JNDI."

3. build.xml is modified to ease the build process. in order to test it.
Following thing need to be changed.
	3.1 in build.xml, "jboss_home" property should point to the base directory of jboss. all the other libs will resolved based on this dir.
	3.2 Database configuration should be changed according to your environment. 
		3.2.1 test_files/hibernate.cfg.xml
		3.2.2 test_files/informix-ds.xml
	3.3 the latest ear file, was always backed for rescure. If any problem occurs, you can modify the informix-ds.xml in the ear file, and deploy it to jboss manually. Then run the test.
  3.4 the test_files/jndi.properties, is used for jndi set. (normally, it not need to change, if you use jboss without any change.)
4. How to test it? If you finish all the configuraiton change, two steps need to run the test.
	4.1 start the jboss.
	4.2 run 'ant test'


That's all!

Thanks for your review.
