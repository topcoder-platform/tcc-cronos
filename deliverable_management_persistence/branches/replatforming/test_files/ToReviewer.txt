Dear reviewer

Please note that this component requires Deliverable Managment
in version 1.1, you will find the implementation in 
test_files\deliverable_management directory.

To run the test you will need to set up the database:

#1 First use the ddl script in the dbschema.sql
(it includes submission_type_lu table)

#2 Modify the dbfactory.xml with you database settings.

Then the tests should execute successfully.

Have a nice day.
