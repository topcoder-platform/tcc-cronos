/**
 * Default Persistence plugin provided with this component, which uses an Informix Database for storage. It implements the three required methods from the AuditPersistence interface it implements. In addition to this, two private utitily methods are provided to help loading information, which can be used and modified at the discretion of the developer. Similarly, mutiple private static final SQL statement strings have been provided to demonstrate what the SQL should be doing. This class also stores a database connection factory and connection name to provide access to a configurable database connection, as well as creating a default values contain on construction, used when loaded audit headers have missing information. Finally, this class is threadsafe - its two database members are immutable after construction and the insert/deletes are performed atomically per audit record, all rolled back when an error occurs. The defaultValues member, while it can be changed, is not altered after construction, so is thread safe.
 * Changes in version 3.2:
 * All transaction management removed
 * Constructor takes programmatic configuration rather than ConfigManager namespace
