=====================================================
Setup:

- Follow the required steps to test the component in section 4.1 of the CS (in docs folder),
  as it has all the instructions you need to setup your environment and run the tests/demo.

- Dependency code is in test_files\mock.

=====================================================
Other Notes:

- There was some confusion in forum on validations. For example, ARS 1.2.9.1 says for contest prizes
  (both for studio and software contests) that 1st/2nd place prizes are required to be present and 2nd place prize
  must be >= 20% of first place prize. Please note, designer confirmed we *do* need to do these validations from the ARS.
  *** Refer to second question from this thread: http://forums.topcoder.com/?module=Thread&threadID=678204&start=16

- Note that designer also required that we validate at most 2 decimal places for cents.

- Note that co-pilot confirmed that struts 2.1.8.1 is required for this comp (I updated dependencies
  section of CS to reflect this change):

- Package name was changed: http://forums.topcoder.com/?module=Thread&threadID=678321&start=0
  I included the updated build.version and also build.xml with my submission.

- There were a lot of other design changes, many definition changes also,
