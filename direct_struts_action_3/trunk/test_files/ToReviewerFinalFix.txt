Hi Beijing2008,

Please see below for some notes on the FF.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
yuanyeyuanye 2.1.1 - Please confirm with the designer for the signature whether "executeAction()"  in the
xxxAction class should be defined as "protected" or "public". 

I made all the executeAction methods protected, this seems to be the most logical way since method
signature in BaseDirectStrutsAction is:
protected abstract void executeAction() throws Exception;

I didn't change it during the competition because public was what was used in tcuml. But I agree with
reviewer here we probably want to make them protected.  If you think we need to get designer involved,
you can reject the FF, but I don't think it's necessary here.

Beijing2008 3.1.4 - For XXXXAction#execute(), if an error is thrown, Is there any particular reason for
which you set the result twice (both in method execute() and executeAction() )? 

I double checked the forum, and actually the co-pilot has confirmed the designer's approach (catch exception,
add to to model, then rethrow). You can refer to this thread:
http://forums.topcoder.com/?module=Thread&threadID=678247&start=15&mc=25

murphydog: "Urmass's response is confirmed."

So I think since we have co-pilot/designer approval here, everything should be ok and no further
forum clarifications are necessary. If you disagree, you can reject the FF, but I just didn't see
the need here to get further clarification since it was confirmed multiple times in that thread
that we need to add the exception to the model.
