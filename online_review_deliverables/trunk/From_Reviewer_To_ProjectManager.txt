Due to the developer and the reviewers use different test datas (fixed once they are inserted into the database), 
in order to run all the test cases together via ant, I created 4 databases for developer and the 3 reviewers' tests
respectively.

Step 1. Build developer's database - create a database named: developer, run the or.sql then Lookups.sql
        You can change the config by modifying the /test_files/db_conf.xml

Step 2. Build failure reviewer's database - create a database named: failuretest, run the or.sql.
        You can change the config by modifying the /test_files/failuretest/dbconfig.xml
        
Step 3. Build stress reviewer's database - create a database named: stresstest, run the test_files/stress/tables.sql then the data.sql.
        You can change the config by modifying the /test_files/stress/dbconfig.xml
        
Step 4. Build accuracy reviewer's database - create a database named: accuracytest, run the test_files/or.sql.
        You can change the config by modifying the /test_files/accuracytests/configurations.xml
        

Note,

In the submitted test cases of the accuracy reviewer, some serious issues exists, but have been modified by the primary reviewer.

Here is my e-mail to PM for reference what have been changed:

===========================================================================================================================
Some serious issues still exist in the accuracy tests.

1. The sql file: /test_files/accuracytests/preconditions.sql, some constraints are violated:
    His first two statements are:
   insert into project_status_lu values (1,"name","description","creation_user",CURRENT,"modify_user",CURRENT);
   insert into project values (1,1,1,"creation_user",CURRENT,"modify_user",CURRENT);

  However, id "1" of the project_category_lu is not set.. so, must modify to be:
  INSERT INTO project_type_lu(project_type_id, name, description, create_user, create_date, modify_user, modify_date) 
     VALUES(1, 'Component', 'Component', 'System', CURRENT, 'System', CURRENT);
  INSERT INTO project_category_lu(project_category_id, project_type_id, name, description, create_user, create_date, modify_user, modify_date)
     VALUES(1, 1, 'Design', 'Design', 'System', CURRENT, 'System', CURRENT);
  insert into project_status_lu values (1,"name","description","creation_user",CURRENT,"modify_user",CURRENT);
  insert into project values (1,1,1,"creation_user",CURRENT,"modify_user",CURRENT);

  and some corresponding modifications in the AccuracyTestHelper#clearTables() are needed.

2. In the test cases, for example, in SubmissionDeliverableCheckerTest, the follow test:

    public final void testFillInQueryParameters1() throws Exception {
        assertEquals(deliverable.getProject(), ((IfxInteger) getParametersVector().get(0)).toLong());
    }

   The accuracy reviewer use a 3rd component (the ifx jdbc driver)  and use reflection to do the assert.
   However, a class cast exception is thrown (mainly due to the version issue of the jdbc driver).

   Both the winner of the component and I encountered this problem.

  I don't think the accuracy reviewer should use the jdbc driver to do the assert.  But it is a hard work for him to rewrite all these test cases, so I just 
  fix some version problems. (IfxInteger --> IfxInt8 in my version of jdbc driver).

Actually, the winner's final fix is ok.. but it seems that the accuracy tests have more bug than the developer. ^_^.

I don't want the project to delay, so for the above two problems, I fixed it myselft. And the modified test cases are in the attached file.
Please send this file to the accuracy reviewer to confirm.. 

Thanks a lot.
