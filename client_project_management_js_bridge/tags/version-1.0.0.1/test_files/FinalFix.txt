Final Fix 1:

1) About parent project id
I check the codes again.
It's a bug in this component.
private Long parentProjectId;
But in getter/setter it's used as long.
So I can not check the variable when it's null, exception will occur.

In my component. I change it into long and compile it into client_project_entities_do.jar.
I put in test_files/lib and remove original file about entities.
Then all test passed.


2) I use real servlet instead of the mock one.

3) Add Log

4) Add more failure test. Such as service is null and method is null.
