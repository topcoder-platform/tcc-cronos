/**
 * <p>
 * This class is an implementation of UserReliabilityCalculator that uses information about N (or less if not enough
 * exist yet) recent projects to calculate the reliability. The reliability calculation formula is
 * SUM(reliable_project_weights)/SUM(all_project_weights); here weights are configurable and are specified based on
 * the chronological order of the projects: i.e. weight for the most recent project, weight for the last but one
 * project, etc. The expected usage of this class is to use higher weight for newer projects and lower weights for
 * older projects.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>Thread Safety: </strong> This class is mutable and not thread safe. But it's assumed that configure()
 * method will be called just once right after instantiation, before calling any business methods (in this case this
 * class is used in thread safe manner).
 * </p>
