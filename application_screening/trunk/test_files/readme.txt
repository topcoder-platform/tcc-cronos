Hi.

As XMI Parser component new version is not developed, and cannot provide
necessary functionality, I've done mock implementation so that it was
possible to test Application Screening component. 
Although all diagrams are hard-coded, real xmi files are provided too 
and situated in unittests/xmi directory. Also, in this directory you
can find corresponding zuml files so that to see how diagrams look like.

Please, add xmiparsermock.jar to classpath and than you can run tests.
