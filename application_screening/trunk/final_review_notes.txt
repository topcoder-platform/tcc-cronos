1. since the updated xmi parser are not available, everyone use his own mock stub for it,
so,
 the unittests, failuretests, stresstests can pass under test_files/stub/xmiparsermock.jar;
 the accuracytests can pass under test_files/stub/xmiparsermock_accuracy.jar;
 and xerces 2.6.2 dependency: that is xml-apis.jar and xercesImpl.jar.
(note that xerces1.4.4 cannot do.)
