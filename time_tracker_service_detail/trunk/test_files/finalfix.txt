-- Final Fix

1. I can't use checkBatchError in deleteServiceDetails since the input is array of long and
   checkBatchError parameter is array of Invoice

2. KLW 3.1.4 I've fixed it, please be careful

3. KLW 4.1.2 I've deleted all EntityNotFoundException from add retrieveServiceDetails(#invoiceId)
