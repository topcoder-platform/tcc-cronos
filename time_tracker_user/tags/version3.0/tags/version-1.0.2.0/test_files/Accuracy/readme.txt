 Hello,

      In order to run my tests, first create all tables needed (they are all
located in Time_Tracker_User.sql, Authorization.sql, Account_Statuses.sql,
id_generator.sql). 
      
     For detail of the config information about informix, please refer to 
DBConnectionFactory.xml file.
     
     Thank you and good luck to all.
