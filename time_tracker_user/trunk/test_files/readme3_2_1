List of changes:

1. I do so many enhancement to the code (both old code and the new code).
   Redundancies are removed and thus, several utility classes are
   introduced.

2. I made some changes to the method signatures, especially in throw
   documentation as the thread in the forum and also some others which
   are not mentioned in the forum. I have good reasons and the old code
   supports my reason. I don't ask this in the forum for my advantage.

3. As ivern stated:
   - version is only changed in the modified classes, those are classes
     that are new or updated in the new design, or classes that are
     modified due to refactoring. Small changes doesn't count
   - since is only added to the modified classes with the same rule as
     above
   - since is also added to new methods in old classes. Methods in new
     classes doesn't need any since information since the information
     is already included in the class.
   - I added the new designer to all classes that he marks as new or
     updated in his design
   - I added TCSDEVELOPER to all classes that I modify (including the
     one changed for refactoring) and also to utility classes

4. The tests documentation is also done with the same rule

5. Accuracy, failure and stress tests are not included. I remember this
   is stated in forum that it is reviewers job to include them (if they
   want to reuse them).

6. As also mentioned in the forum, since there is a parent child
   relation in the exceptions, developers only have to mention the
   parent in the method signature and mention ALL exceptions in the
   documentation.
