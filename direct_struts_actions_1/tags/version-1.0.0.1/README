1. For projectId and contestId, @IntRangeFieldValidator can not be used, as the projectId and cotestId is long type. If IntRangeFieldValidator is used, exception will raised.
2. validation annotation can be tested through demo, like following http://localhost:8080/demo/saveDraftContest?startDate=8/1/2010&endDate=8/1/2010&contestName=Test&competitionType=STUDIO
if validated, it will show sucess page, or Validation Fails page (simply text).   
3. the SHORT format of date string is like 8/1/2010.
4. in XMLGregorianCalendarTypeConverter, I use XWorkBasicConverter instead of DefaultTypeConverter, as it can not handle convert Date type. you can check 
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/struts/struts2/trunk/xwork-core/src/main/java/com/opensymphony/xwork2/conversion/impl/DefaultTypeConverter.java
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/struts/struts2/trunk/xwork-core/src/main/java/com/opensymphony/xwork2/conversion/impl/XWorkBasicConverter.java
5. For primitive type, I have test it, it seems @RequiredFieldValidator does not work, as the validation is actually after setter, and by convert the primitive to corresponding Java type. it will never null.
6. a ant target "demo" is defined in build-dependencies.xml to create test_files/demo.war which can be directly deployed into tomcat for validation check.


Thanks for your review.
