1. Correct the "jboss.home" and "jboss.server" properties in build.xml


2. Use "ant deployToJBoss" to compile sources and package into jar and deploy it to JBoss.


3. Start JBoss, with successful deployment, go to http://localhost:8080/jbossws/services, there should show the service end point like following:

ServiceEndpointID 	jboss.ws:context=ResourceManagerServiceBeanService,endpoint=ResourceManagerServiceBean
ServiceEndpointAddress 	http://127.0.0.1:8080/ResourceManagerServiceBeanService/ResourceManagerServiceBean?wsdl

    Check the WSDL property in /test_files/url.properties to point to the correct WSDL URL according to your env

4. "ant test".



About the Resource.properties map:

    The Resource.properties map does not have proper getter/setter, so they can not be marshalled/unmarshalled when passing between client and server.
    In other words, the properties map's values will get lost.
    
    So i extend the Resource to hold an addition properties map which can be properly marshalled/unmarshalled. And the ResourceManagerServiceClient
    and ResourceManagerServiceBean will take care the sync of the new properties map and the original properties map.
 


About jars:

    1. The mock Registration Framework is under /test_reflib/registration_framework_mock.jar
    
    2. The log4j used by JBossWS may confilct with the log4j used by Cobertura since they are different version.
       You may encounter the issue when coverage report. The workaround is to Repalce the log4j used by Cobertura1.8 with log4j-1.2.14.
