=====================================================
Setup:

- Follow the required steps to test the component in section 4.1 of the CS (in docs folder),
  as it has all the instructions you need to setup your environment and run the tests/demo.

- Dependency code is in test_files\mock.

=====================================================
Notes/Enhancements:

- Note that catch(Exception e) is approved (by copilot) for this component:

- The contest service facade in the wiki is wrong. The correct one is the one posted by mashannon168 at this link:

- Struts 2.1.8.1 is required, I updated CS to reflect this.

- Note the class name changes (I updated CS 1.5 to reflect these name changes):

Enhancements:
1) Added a config example to CS for struts.xml and applicationContext.xml.
2) In execute methods, I provided extra checking for required injected fields
   to make sure they aren't null so that meaningful exception message can be
   stored in model instead of just letting NPE get thrown.
