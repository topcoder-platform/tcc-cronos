- build-dependencies.xml has been modified to list all the jars.

- For onsky's review, I removed the public from the Helper method (co-pilot said this was recommended, but not required),
  but for the other item co-pilot said the way I used was preferred.
  
  Here is co-pilot's response:
  
"I agree that neither of these are issues that should have affected the
score, and I personally prefer your way of short-circuiting the if
statement.  Yanbo or Volodymyr, can you please raise the 3.1.2 score
here to a 4 and change the one required item to recommended?"

*** You can refer to the scorecard to see the manager correction for that item.
