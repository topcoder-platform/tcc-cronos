The  unit testing reveals following bugs with server side components:

Submission Manager component

1) SubmissionManagerBean.DELETED_STATUS constant has a value ("deleted") which does not match the value
   from respective record from SUBMISSION_STATUS_LU table ("Deleted").
sma: done

Studio Service component

1) StudioServiceBean.convertSubmissionData(SubmissionData) method does not convert all submission details.
   For instance, converted Submission instance does not have a "contest" property set. As result
   StudioService.updateSubmission method fails with error like:
    
   org.hibernate.PropertyValueException: not-null property references a null or transient value:
       com.topcoder.service.studio.submission.Submission.contest
sma: add Contest

2) StudioServiceBean.convertContest(Contest, boolean) method computes the durationInHours incorrectly when
   converting Contest objects to ContestData objects. The line:
   
   double durationInHours = (contest.getEndDate().getTime() - contest.getStartDate().getTime()) / (60 * 60 * 1000);

   looses up to 1 hour due to issue with precision of division operation.

3) SubmissionData, ContestData, ContestPaymentData, MediumData classes are not properly annotated with @XmlType
   annotation causing the JAXB context to fail

4) StudioServiceBean.convertSubmissionData(SubmissionData) method does not set the "contest" property of converted
   Submission instance. This causes SubmissionManager to raise an error like below when updating submission: 

   org.hibernate.PropertyValueException: not-null property references a null or transient value:
       com.topcoder.service.studio.submission.Submission.contes

Studio Contest Manager component

1) ContestManagerBean.getContestsForProject(long) method does not filter out deleted contests.

2) ContestManagerBean.addChangeHistory(List) method passes entire List to EntityManager for persisting which causes
   an error like: "Unknown entity: java.util.ArrayList" to be raised by Hibernate

Project Service component

1) StudioCompetition class is not properly annotated with 11:06 AM 1/6/2009 annotation causing the JAXB context to fail
sma:done
