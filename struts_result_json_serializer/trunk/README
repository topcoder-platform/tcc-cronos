a) I provide a jboss demo, here it the steps to run the demo.
1. Put all the files in tests_files/struts_result_json_serializer.war into %JBOSS_HOME_PATH%/server/default/deploy/struts_result_json_serializer.war
2. run jboss.
3. input http://127.0.0.1:8080/struts_result_json_serializer/demo.action in your explorer to see the demo :  the result should be :  
It's a demo : {result: {name: tc, return: {"description":"project_description","id":100,"name":"project_name"}}}
4. you can change the java been set in application.xml to see different result.
5. stop jboss

b) the $[] is used for the token name, for the spring requiremnet


in final fix :
1. the function name of setDataPreprocessor is changed to setDataPreProcessor
2. The results in the model are to be found under key "return", not "result"  see :
