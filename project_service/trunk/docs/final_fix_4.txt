Each entity has its separate ID Generator.
Algorithm 1.3.2 is modified to use the ID Generator.
Algorithm 1.3.3 is added to address this.

UserServiceBean is not aggregated with IDGenerator, as the separate generators 
could be retrieved from the IDGeneratorFactory via static methods by the id generator name

The section 3.2 of CS are updated with the id generator names, and the class diagram are also updated.
