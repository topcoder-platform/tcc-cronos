Setup
------------------------------------------------------
Database

1. install Informix and make sure the database is started.
2. create a database named 'project' in Informix.
3. use 'dbaccess project <path>/test_files/create.sql' to create database. it will create tables and sequences. Note, you can use 'dbaccess project <path>/test_files/drop.sql' to drop tables and sequences.
4. change the ip address and port and username and password in test_files/informix-ds.xml and test_files/InformixDBConnectionFactory.xml and test_files/META-INF/hibernate.cfg.xml.

Here, database is ready.

JBoss

1. Download and install JBoss 4.2.2.
2. modify <jboss-home\server\default\conf\login-config.xml, adding

   <application-policy name="JBossLoginModule">
	    <authentication>
	      <login-module code="com.topcoder.security.auth.module.JBossLoginModule"
	        flag="required">
	        <module-option name="fileName">D:/Review/Project_Service/test_files/demoConfigs.properties</module-option>
	        <module-option name="password-stacking">useFirstPass</module-option>
	      </login-module>
	    </authentication>
  </application-policy>
  
  
  Notes, fileName property should be point to test_files/demoConfigs.properties file.

3. change demoConfigs.properties, using the correct path for JBossLoginModule.xml.

Build.xml

1. there are some settings need to be adjusted according to your environment.
like
1.1 "configuration for checkstyles"
1.2 "codertura task definitation"
1.3 <property name="jboss_home" value="E:/TC_Hermes_Jboss_Upgrade_4.2.2GA" />
1.4 See build.xml for required tcs jars and third party jars

Now, all the setup is ready. Let's start.

1. start Jboss 4.2.2
2. use 'ant deployEAR', to package ear file and deploy to jboss, a latest built is alredy saved as test_files/project_service.ear.
3. use 'ant test' to run the test cases.
4. 'ant undeployEAR' is used to delete the ear file in JBoss. and 'ant package.ejb' is used to package the ejb jar.

This is the most simplified process I can offer you:)

Other Notes
------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. About the coverage report, there are some issue with using codertura with jboss. So the coverage report is incorrect. I covered all the case for testing.
