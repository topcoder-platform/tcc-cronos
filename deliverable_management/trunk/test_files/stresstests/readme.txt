Hello,
     In order to run my test, please first run
sql script in deliverable_management.sql. Also DBConnectionFactory.xml
should be modified to be available for your mechine.
All config files are located under "test_files/stresstests/".

    Since the first id generated by the id generate factory is 1, this id
will be somehow the same with the records id which I want to insert in the
testing setup.

    So please running my tests for more than once.

    I think there is no problem with my tests. If I improved the source
code provided by developer, all test cases can pass.

    On my mechine, all stress tests will be running more than 2 mins, please
be patient.

 Good luck all.

 Thank you.
