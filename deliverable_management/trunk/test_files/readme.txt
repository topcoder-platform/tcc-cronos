
To run the test, first run the script of dbschema.sql.

Thank you.

NOTE:

1. Search bundle name of DELIVERABLE_WITH_SUBMISSIONS_SEARCH_BUNDLE_NAME 

has been changed from  "Submission Search Bundle" to "Deliverable With Submission Search Bundle".

So i modified the config files of all tests to make it work.


2. Some test cases in failure test is unnecessary, see
