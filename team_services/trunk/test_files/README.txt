Hi reviewers:

1)This component denpends on some unimplemented components, I have mock them, they are provided under test_files directory(including compiled package and source files). To run my test, adds mocks to CLASS_PATH first.

2)Actually, I think the most difficult part of this component is writing test cases, there are so many corner cases(a lot of validations). To test these cost me most of the time, fortunately I made it to reach 85% coverage.

3) A new exception class TeamServicesException is added according to dev forum.

4)CS has been updated, marked as RED.

Thanks!
