             Installation Notes for IBM Informix JDBC Driver

3.70.JC1, October 2010

This file contains instructions for installing and uninstalling IBM® Informix® 
JDBC Driver 3.70.JC1.


JDK REQUIREMENT
_____________________________

To use IBM Informix JDBC Driver Version 3.70.JC1, you must use a 
JDK 1.6 or later package on your platform. 



OBTAINING THE JDBC DRIVER
_____________________________

You can obtain the IBM Informix JDBC Driver from the IBM Informix JDBC Driver 
product CD, from the JDBC directory of the IBM Informix product bundle CD, or 
you can download the driver from 
http://www.ibm.com/software/data/informix/tools/jdbc

The CD or Web site download contain the following files:

*  setup.jar
*  doc/jdbcrel.htm
*  doc/install.txt (this file)
*  doc/patchinfo.htm

The setup.jar file is the IBM Informix JDBC Driver installation program.

The documentation directory, <dir>/doc, contains the release notes file in 
HTML format. Refer to this document for any new information that is not 
available in the manual.



INSTALLING THE JDBC DRIVER
_____________________________

Prerequisites:

If you downloaded the IBM Informix JDBC Driver as .zip file from the Web site, 
unzip the file to a directory.

If you are installing the driver from a CD, load the CD into the CD-ROM drive.

If you are installing the driver as part of the Informix installation program,
follow the steps in the IBM Installation Guide for your operating system.

INSTALLING JDBC DRIVER IN GRAPHICAL OR CONSOLE MODE

1. From a command prompt, start the installation program by using one of
   the following commands:
   *  To start in graphical mode:
      java -jar <dir>/setup.jar install -i gui

   *  To start in console mode: 
      java -jar <dir>/setup.jar install -i console

      Where <dir> is the location of the setup.jar file.

      An installation log is available in your installation location, 
      in a file called
      IBM_Informix_JDBC_Driver_Version_3.70_InstallLog.log

2. Read the license agreement and accept the terms. Respond to the
   prompts as the installation guides you.

3. When prompted, accept the default directory or specify a different
   directory.

   On Windows, the default directory is:    

   C:\Program Files\IBM\Informix_JDBC_Driver

   
4. When prompted, verify the location of the installation path.

   The installer installs the JDBC driver and notifies you that an
   uninstaller is being added to the installation directory.

   Note: If the installation stalls when connected to an NFS-mounted file 
         system, you should first try resolving NFS issues. In some cases, 
         unmounting and remounting the share can resolve the issue. Otherwise,
         forcefully terminate the installation, clean up any orphaned 
         processes, and restart the installation.

5. Specify Finish when you see this message: 
   InstallShield Wizard has successfully installed IBM Informix JDBC Driver.
   

INSTALLING INFORMIX JDBC DRIVER IN SILENT MODE

From a command prompt, run the following command:

java -jar <dir>/setup.jar install -i silent 
     -DUSER_INSTALL_DIR=<destination-dir> -DLICENSE_ACCEPTED=TRUE

Where:

<dir> is the location of setup.jar file.

<destination-dir> is the directory where you want to install the JDBC Driver.

The installation is complete when the command has finished executing.

An installation log is available in your installation location, in a file 
called IBM_Informix_JDBC_Driver_Version_3.70_InstallLog.log


UNINSTALLING THE JDBC DRIVER
_____________________________

When you install IBM Informix JDBC Driver, an uninstall application is added 
to the directory where you installed the JDBC Driver. Uninstalling IBM 
Informix JDBC Driver completely removes the driver and all of its components 
from your computer.

The following section describes how to uninstall IBM Informix JDBC Driver on 
all platforms.

Tip: If the <destination-dir> in which you installed the IBM Informix JDBC 
     Driver includes spaces in its pathname, enclose the entire pathname in 
     quotation marks when executing the uninstall command.
      


UNINSTALLING IN GRAPHICAL OR CONSOLE MODE

If you installed the Informix JDBC driver by using the Informix installation
program, you must use run the uninstall executable program that was
added to your computer when the driver was installed. Refer to the 
Informix JDBC Programmer's Guide for the specific steps to uninstall 
the driver.

If you installed the Informix JDBC driver separately from other Informix
programs, run one of the following commands to start the uninstall program. 
The <destination-dir> is the directory in which you installed the IBM Informix 
JDBC Driver:

To uninstall in graphical mode:

java -jar <destination-dir>/uninstall/uninstall_jdbc/uninstaller.jar -i gui


To uninstall in console mode:

java -jar <destination-dir>/uninstall/uninstall_jdbc/uninstaller.jar -i console


Follow the prompts to uninstall the JDBC driver.



UNINSTALLING IN SILENT MODE

Run the following command to start the uninstall program in silent mode, where 
<destination-dir> is the directory in which you installed the IBM Informix 
JDBC Driver:


java -jar <destination-dir>/uninstall/uninstall_jdbc/uninstaller.jar -silent

The Uninstall program does not send you any messages but uninstalls the driver 
in silent mode.
