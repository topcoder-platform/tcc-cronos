 * <p>
 * This class provides the function to get lookup id from a lookup name of
 * &quot;submission_status_lu&quot; table. Since lookup id/value pairs do not
 * change in the database per installation, this class caches the id/value
 * pairs to minimize queries to the database. This class is used in various
 * methods of PhaseHandler implementations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Change in 1.4: <br/>
 * Made {@link #CACHED_PAIRS} type generic, added &quot;final&quot; modified to the variable and changed
 * name to upper case to meet Java and TopCoder standards.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Thread safety: This class is thread safe because its static method is
 * synchronized.
