a.
run the test cases

1. set up the database, executes test_files/sqls/all.sql(updated in this version)

2. change the configuration in test_files/config/DB_Factory.xml and user_project_data_store.xml

3. setup the email-engine setting too. dev null smtp server should start first.

b.
broken test cases are fixed, Many test cases are added and improved for all phase handlers, the coverage for the whole submission is still low, but most are wrapping of the thrown exception by other components. 
c.
all the reviewers' test cases are not in the scope of submission.

d. since the test cases are mostly db related, so it takes long time to execute, please be patient.
