/**
 * <p>
 * LoginHandler implements the Handler interface from FrontController component,
 * it processes the login request to check the user's credentials (email address
 * and password, for instance) and, if they are correct, it stores the user's
 * profile as a session attribute. The names of the request parameters from
 * which to obtain credentials are configuable, and the names of the User
 * Profile properties to which the credentials correspond are configuable too.
 * This handler uses the provided credentials to both obtain the appropriate
 * profile from the User Profile Manager, and to determine whether the
 * credentials are consistent with that profile. Its execute method will return
 * null if the profile is found and the credentials match, otherwise it will
 * return a configurable result name string, it also provides a static method:
 * getAuthenticatedUser to get profile of logged-in user from session.
 * 
 * Two constructors are provided, one takes a map of configurable attributes,
 * and the other loads the attributes from a xml Element object, refer to the
 * component specification to see the format of the xml element.
 * 
 * Threadsafety: This class is thread-safe, since it is immutable, and the
 * UserProfileManager object is only used to read UserProfile objects from
 * persistence, concrete UserProfileManager implementation must ensure the
 * search operation is thread-safe. The UserProfile object is stored in session
 * by this handler, and then it can be accessed by the other handlers. Session
 * objects are not necessarily to be thread-safe, and it is up to end-user to
 * not modify it from different threads - This strategy is widely used in
 * web-applications.
 * </p>
