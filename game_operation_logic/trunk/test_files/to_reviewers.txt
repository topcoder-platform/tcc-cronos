Here are some notes for reviewers for final fix:
to assistant:
a) RegisterGameHandlerTest#testRegisterGameHandler_Element_NoParamKey
	the sample xml you provided was not correct, game_id_param_key is expected to be null but existing, please be noted.


to all Zulander and catcher:
a) I found there are some conflicts on the environment configuration between my tests and yours.
	Most of your tests depend on the default config set in ConfigManager.properties, but in each test of mine,
	I will always clear all the namespaces, for this reason, while aggregate all the tests in AllTests,
	the stress tests and accuracy tests won't get the proper config as expected and failed. Plz be noted.

to all reviewers:
a) PuzzleSolutionHandler#ctor is changed by adding new string argument, according to https://software.topcoder.com/forum/c_forum_message.jsp?f=24092901&r=24515339
	So, the relative tests for this class should be modified as well.

b) There are still some fixes should be done, but I didn't have time to finish them in 24 hours(final fix stage always lasts only 24 hours?). The deadline is approaching, I have no idea what
will happen if I don't post a submission on time, so, even though it's not complete, I still hand up this submission.
