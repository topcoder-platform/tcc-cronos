Dear Reviewers,
Thank you very much for your review.
There are some thing I want to make it clear here.

1,
about the mock classes.
This component need to mock many classes.
beside the "MockComponents" provided at the forum->Development Phase Documents ,
I have write the following four mock classes to test the component.
In order to make "ant test" successful,  
the following mock classes have to be put in the test path.
The  mock classes can be found at "./test_files/MockClasses"
==========================================
MockBanManager.java
MockProjectServicesImpl.java
MockTeamManagerImpl.java
MockTeamImpl.java
============================================

2,
about MockBanManager.java.
"public boolean isBanned(long userId)" is used for test.

This mocked method will return true if "userId == 3",
return false if "userId != 3".

3,
about MockTeamManagerImpl.java.
"public Team getTeam(long teamId)"is used for test.

for this mocked method
if (teamId == 1) the returned team has a position that is filled.
else the returned team has no position that are filled.

4,
about MockProjectServicesImpl.java.
public FullProjectData[] findActiveProjects()  is used in the test.

This method is used to count all projects 
whose activeProject.resources contains a given resource.id.

This mocked method will return three activeProject.
and all three activeProject will contains two resources, 
one of the resource.id is 11, the other is 66.

Thank you again for your review. 
Wellcome for all your advice which will help me very much in future.

Best Wishes
