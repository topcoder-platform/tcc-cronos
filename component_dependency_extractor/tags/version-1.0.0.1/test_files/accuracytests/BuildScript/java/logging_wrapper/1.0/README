  -------------------------
  JDK 1.3+  <http://java.sun.com>
  Apache Ant 1.5.1+  <http://www.apache.org>
  JUnit 3.8+  <http://www.junit.org>
      Note: The junit.jar should be located inside the Ant lib/ directory in 
      order to build the component test cases.
  
  
  TopCoder Software Environment Configuration
  -------------------------------------------
  TopCoder Software has defined a directory structure to promote component reuse
  and facilitate Component Based Development.
  
  If you have already configured your environment, please continue with the
  Component Installation Instructions.
  
  Steps to setting up your environment:
  1- Designate a directory on your file system as your TCS_HOME.
     (i.e. c:\tcs or /etc/home/user/tcs)
  2- Using a text editor, create a file named topcoder_global.properties in your TCS_HOME directory.
     This file will be used to overwrite any Ant build properties defined in each TopCoder Software 
     component build script.
  3- When overwriting properties, use the PROPERTYNAME=PROPERTYVALUE format.
     To overwrite the TopCoder Software /lib and 3rd party /lib directories, set these properties in
     the topcoder_global.properties file:
     
     tcs_libdir={PATH}
     ext_libdir={PATH}
     
     For Example:
     tcs_libdir=e:/tcs/cvs/tcs/lib/tcs
     ext_libdir=e:/tcs/cvs/tcs/lib
     
     Notes: Only define one property per line.
          : Enter text at the begining of the line.
          : Do not include any whitespace.
          
  4- All TopCoder Software components are distributed with Ant (ant.apache.org) based build scripts
     and Junit (www.junit.org) based test cases.  Please properly install and configure these tools 
     before working with TopCoder Software components.
     Note: Be sure to place the junit.jar in the ANT_HOME/lib directory.
