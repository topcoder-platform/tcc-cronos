TO RUN:

1. Install the component structure in ${basedir}

2. Create "topcoder_global.properties" in ${basedir}/.. and add the properties from steps 2,3,4

	ext_libdir - root of third party libraries
	tcs_libdir - root of topcoder components
	java_1_5_bootclasspath - installation path for java 1.5 (only needed for compile_targets task)

4. The following standard build script properties can be changed (defaults are noted)
	debug=off - as expected
	verbose=no - as expected
	cobertura.dir=${ext_libdir}/cobertura/1.8

    ./test_files/log4j.xml
    ./test_files/logging.properties
    ./test_files/accuracytests/log4j.xml
    ./test_files/accuracytests/logging.properties
    ./test_files/META-INF/persistence.xml   
    
2. To set up MySql database execute ./test_files/create.sql file.

3. After testing, please drop the table by executing ./test_files/drop.sql file.
