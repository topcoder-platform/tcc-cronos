1. Use /test_files/DRSchema.ddl and /test_files/id_sequences.sql to setup database

2. Correct database url/username/password in:

    /test_files/informix-ds.xml
    /test_files/META-INF/hibernate.cfg.xml
    /test_files/com/topcoder/db/connectionfactory/DBConnectionFactoryImpl.xml
    
3. Correct "jboss_home" and "jboss_config_name" in build-dependencies.xml

4. Ensure all jars in build-dependencies.xml are present

5. ant deployEAR

6. Start JBoss

7. ant test

for final reviewer
1. klw's the function for addTrackProjectType and removeTrackProjectType can not work, see my tests for detail.
   please see this thread 'http://forums.topcoder.com/?module=Thread&threadID=617778&start=0'
   the review response is incorrect. and the test cases should be updated. I have noticed the pm about this.
   I will let them know again.
2. for 'Please consider IllegalArgumentException from Field#set  Since new DAO's may not implement AbstractDAO, it's quite possible scenario.'
   I changed the method in the last final fix as
   'if (clz != null && clz.isAssignableFrom(instance.getClass())) {
                field = clz.getDeclaredField(name);
            } else {
                field = instance.getClass().getDeclaredField(name);
            }'
   so if the dao does not implemente AbstractDAO, it will go to its own class to find the Field.
   if this still not work, could you please simple let me know where the problem is?
3. for 5.1.4, I think I already fixed this in last final fix
