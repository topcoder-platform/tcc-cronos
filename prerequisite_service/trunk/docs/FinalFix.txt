1.1.2	replaced
1.1.3	use cases added/replaced
2.1.4	I think that (URL,QNAME) constructor is sufficient since it delegates and comprises all combinations to the parent constructor. 
2.1.6	it's ok
3.1.5	no, the "normal distribution" for topcoder in Java is the entire Java Standard Edition, in C#.Net is the library.
		The question 3.5 speaks about the normal distribution, not java.lang or java.util: "Relationships to system classes (ie classes that are installed with the normal distributions ? this does not include J2EE classes) do not need to be shown unless they are part of an extends or inherits relationship."
		I show only the J2EE relationships. (Wendell is correct in his comment about J2EE and normal distribution)
		I marked the aggregations private
4.1.2	doc changed
4.1.6	fixed
