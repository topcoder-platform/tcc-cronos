1. Copy all jar files from test_reflib into the folder created in step 1.
2. Download a tomcat. This demo is tested under tomcat 6.0.29. So I think you'd better use a tomcat no lower than this
version.
3. Copy docs/web-test to your tomcat's webapps folder.
4. Configure jdbc.properties to use the correct value which can connect to your database.
5. Start tomcat.
6. Open a browser. Go to http://localhost:8080/web-test/index.jsp.
7. There are 3 links, each of which is used to test one action. You can enter these link, input searching criteria, and
after you click on the search button, you will see a table containing the searching result.

NOTE: For simplicity (since this is just a demo), if you want to enter multiple value for catalog, type, or subtype,
you need to enter the values delimited by comma. And for date and integer fields, you need to make sure the entered
value is valid.
