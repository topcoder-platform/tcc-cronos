1. Install the Jive Forum
  1.1 Download the Jive Forum.zip. Move the jive4.war to test_files/JiveForumDemo.ear; And rename it to JiveForum.war, or you
      can modify the test_files/JiveForumDemo.ear/META-INF/application.xml to point to your jiveforum.war;
  
  1.2 Remove the  JiveForum.war/WEB-INF/lib/common-logging.jar
  
  1.3 copy the test_files/jboss-web.xml to JiveForum.war/WEB-INF/   (It's used to solve the uncompatible between jboss and jive forum).

  1.4 Copy the folder /jivehome from Jive Forum.zip to your favorite place.

  1.5 Copy the test_files/JiveForumDemo.ear to your ${JBOSS_HOME}/server/default/deploy

  1.6 Start the JBoss

  1.7 Configure the Jive forum. Type http://localhost:8080/JiveForum/admin/setup in the browser.
      (In this step you have to set up the jivehome place, license, and database (use embedded db for testing.)

  Note: If you can proceed successfully, means the jive forum is ok.

2. Set up the environment for testing
Enter the admin tool. http://localhost:8080/JiveForum/admin

2.1 Create the first forum, which id should 1.

2.2 Creates 3 groups first. (this is for testing.)
    "Software_Users_1", "Software_Moderators_1", "Software Admins"

2.3 Create 3 categories. In the demo, I use categoryId 3 as the template category. So you can add sub forum/ category to the
category 3. And then add sub thread, messages, attachment to the forum.

3. Run demo
    ant run
