** Please refer to FinalFix.txt for notes about the final fix.

=====================================================
Setup:

- Follow the required steps to test the component in section 4.1 of the CS (in docs folder),
  as it has all the instructions you need to setup your environment and run the tests.

- IMPORTANT: Note that LoggingInterceptorException was removed (http://forums.topcoder.com/?module=Thread&threadID=666457&start=0)
   **** I have updated the CS to reflect this change (1.5.1)

=====================================================
Improvements/Enhancements:

- I made several enhancements to the documentation. Refer to the class docs in the java code for details
  (ex. see AggregateDataModel.java).

- The biggest challenge was in writing really thorough tests. Please consider the following:

  - Note that I used JWebUnit (http://jwebunit.sourceforge.net) for true GUI testing to make
    sure the interceptors work properly, and this is in addition to my standard unit tests.
    Refer to InterceptorWebTest class for details.

  - I provided comprehensive demos using ActionProxy and GuiDemo using real web navigation through
    the tomcat web site.

  - I used a CustomAppender class to capture the logged messages, to ensure that I could validate
    that the logging interceptor works properly (refer to LoggingInterceptorUnitTest.java).

  - I used the StrutsSpringTestCase to validate the actions/interceptors in a true struts2 environment
    rather than just creating mock objects.
