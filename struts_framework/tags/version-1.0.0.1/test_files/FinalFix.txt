Notes on final fix
======================

The aggregation still reflects FireIce's submission, but I have fixed the items I was scored down for.

================================================
iKnown's review, 3.1.3
================================================
I actually had to keep BaseException as a dependency since LoggingWrapper needs it but I also updated CS 2.2 to reflect this.
I had to move Helper to com.topcoder.service.actions

================================================
onsky's review 3.1.2
================================================
I have removed the redundant checks, now I only check for null. I also had to remove my failure tests that were checking for
the empty string condition in the intercept method. That is why there are now 68 tests instead of
my original 70.

onsky's review 4.1.2
================================================
Successfully re-appealed, no fix required.

morehappiness's review 5.1.2
================================================
If you want to test with JBoss, be sure to rename demo to demo.war after copying test_files/demo to ${JBOSS_HOME}/server/default/deploy folder.
JBoss/Tomcat needs to be running to run the tests. I have tested with both JBoss and Tomcat and both work fine.
