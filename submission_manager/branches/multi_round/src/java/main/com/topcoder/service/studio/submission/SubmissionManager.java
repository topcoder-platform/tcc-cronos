/**
 * <p>
 * The business interface that defines methods for managing a submission, prize,
 * submission payment, and submission review. In general, but not always, it has
 * methods to create, update, delete, get, and list these entities, as well as
 * some methods to perform more important operations. These include getting
 * submissions for a contest or member, updating a submission status or result,
 * adding or removing a prize from a submission, and getting and deleting
 * submission reviews for a submission and/or a reviewer.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <b>Thread Safety</b>: Implementations should perform actions in a thread-safe
 * manner.
 * </p>
 *
 * Update in version 1.2: 1. Three methods are added to support get milestone
 * submissions, get final submissions and set submission milestone prize. 2. Doc
 * is updated to get consistent with the current implementation, see the doc for
 * blue methods for details. Especially, several existing methods are totally
 * missing in the original diagram, they are added in this version.(at the
 * bottom of this interface)
