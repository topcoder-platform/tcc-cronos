This document helps to deploy the component in JBoss

1. Before deploying this component, please make sure that client_project_entities_dao and project_service_1.1.0 components are the newest(they are posted in the form, not int the vm).
   http://forums.topcoder.com/?module=Thread&threadID=666532&start=0
2. Use test_files/ProjectStatus.java to replace
    com.topcoder.clients.model.ProjectStatus.java in client_project_entities_dao component
   Reason: two ProjectStatus class have the some name and namespace, so they will be conflict when deploying to webservice.
3. Make sure that all EJB dependencies are already ready.
4. Edit liquidPortalService.xml(configuration file name) for your configuration.
5. copy conf/liquidPortalService.xml, conf/liquidPortalService.properties to the vm directory: /home/cockpit/jboss-4.2.3.GA/server/default/deploy/cockpit2.1.ear/
6. Edit ejb-jar.xml, you can config the configurationFileName and configurationNamespace parameters.
7. Build this component, copy conf/ejb-jar.xml and conf/jboss.xml to META-INF directory, and package them with classes to a jar file, copy the jar to jboss's deploy directory
   /home/cockpit/jboss-4.2.3.GA/server/default/deploy/cockpit2.1.ear/
8. On VM: sudo killall java -> cd /home/cockpit/jboss-4.2.3.GA/bin -> ./run.sh
