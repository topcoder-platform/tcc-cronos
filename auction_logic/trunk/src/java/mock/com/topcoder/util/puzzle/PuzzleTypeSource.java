 * This interface is referenced from the Auction Logic component but the Puzzle Framework component
 * where it is defined is still under development , so default implementation is used here. After
 * the Puzzle Framework will be released this interface can be removed.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In order to test Auction Logic component mock implementation of this interface is used. But when
 * you will substitute this interface with the real one, some modifications of mock class will be
 * required. Actually the stubs for the all methods should be added.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * An interface defining the behavior of objects that serve as registries or factories of PuzzleType
 * objects.
