1. I use front-controller version 2.0 since all classes referenced from the Auction Logic component
(ActionContext, ...) are not changed in version 2.1

2. Some classes that are referenced from this component are declared in other not-yet-finished
components. So mocks are used here. They are defined under src/java/mock
In order to compile them I've modified build.xml:
a) added 'javamock' property
b) target java_compile is changed to compile mock classes

3. This component uses Jakarta Cactus for testing (it was approved by PM).
As servlet container I use Tomcat. 
You can use my build.xml to create web aplication. In this case you need to
change the ${cactus.path} property
(for details see build_dev.xml)


To run tests:
a) undeploy the current auction_logic from the Tomcat 5.5.16
b) type 'ant create_webapp'
c) copy auction_logic directory from the build/webapp to Tomcat server, ensure that it is
deployed
d) type 'ant test'
