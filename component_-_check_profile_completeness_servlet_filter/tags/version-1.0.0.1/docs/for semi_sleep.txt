3.1.5. 1) As in previous ff, the dependencies from filter.impl package are shown only to com.topcoder.web.common.model.User.
2) com.topcoder.reg.profilecompleteness.filter.impl.retrievers now does not show package-to-package dependency.

4.1.2. 1) This does not give any flexibility and developers then have to provide additional checks, whether this configurable name is not null/empty etc. 
Consider also that if the configuration is done by Spring, then we hardcode the variable name with setter name, in this case, this flexibility is not needed. 

If you state simply "not fixed", please add the comments from previous ff, this is really unnecessary.

4.1.7. Fixed the name. I've also added BaseProfileCompletenessChecker class, which throws the configuration exception, it was missed.
