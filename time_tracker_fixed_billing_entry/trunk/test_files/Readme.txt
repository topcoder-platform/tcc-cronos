1.In SQL file, I have removed the "fix_bill_type_id" field in the fix_bill_entry table. It's confirmed in the Design forum.

2.The latest sql file still has some error. I have removed the error lines.

3.Please insert the test records by running 
 unit test - test_files/test_sql.txt.
 failure - test_files\failure\idseq.sql

4.Use Mock EJB for testing.

Thanks.
