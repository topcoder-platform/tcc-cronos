        <p><strong><u><a name="1" id="1"></a>Our Policy</u></strong><strong>:</strong><br/>
            Welcome to the TheBall.com web site (the &ldquo;<strong>Site</strong>&rdquo;) of TopCoder,
            Inc.<strong> </strong>(&ldquo;<strong>TopCoder</strong>&rdquo;, &ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo;
            and/or &ldquo;our&rdquo;). This Site is operated by TopCoder and has been created to provide information
            about TopCoder and to provide information, instructions, and rules regarding and services relating to The
            Ball contests and online services (&ldquo;<strong>The Ball Services</strong>&rdquo;) to our Site visitors (&ldquo;you&rdquo;, &ldquo;your&rdquo;).
            This Privacy Policy sets forth TopCoder&rsquo;s policy with respect to information including personally
            identifiable data (&ldquo;<strong>Personal Data</strong>&rdquo;) and other information that is collected
            from Site visitors and users of The Ball Services.</p>

        <p><strong><u><a name="2" id="2"></a>Information We Collect</u></strong><strong>:</strong><br/>
            When you interact with us through the Site, we may collect Personal Data and other information from you, as
            further described below:<u></u></p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Personal Data That You Provide Through the Site: </strong>We collect Personal Data from you when
                you voluntarily provide such information, such as when you contact us with inquiries, respond to one of
                our surveys, register for access to The Ball Services or use certain The Ball Services. Wherever
                TopCoder collects Personal Data we make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy. Information
                may be collected through any of a variety of manners, including the input or submission through our
                website or via e-mail, phone, or mail correspondence.</p>

            <p><strong>By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance
                with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data to this Site, you acknowledge and agree that such
                Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of TopCoder and
                the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United States. </strong></p>

            <p><strong>Contest-Related Data: </strong>To participate in The Ball Services, players must download and
                install an extension to their web browser.&nbsp; This web browser extension provides access to the
                contests and to contest-related information, and enables certain contest-related functionality on
                third-party web sites that are participating in the contest (&ldquo;Participating Sites&rdquo;).&nbsp;
                The web browser extension may be activated or deactivated at your option, but must be activated when you
                are participating in a contest.&nbsp; When the web browser extension is activated, the extension will
                periodically contact TopCoder&rsquo;s contest servers.&nbsp; Also, when the web browser extension is
                activated, the web browser extension monitors the web sites that you visit, and determines whether it is
                probable that the site is a Participating Site.&nbsp; In the event that an activated web browser
                extension determines that a web site that you have visited is with a high degree of probability likely
                to be a Participating Site, the web browser extension will contact the contest servers to confirm that
                the site is a Participating Site.&nbsp; When the web browser extension is activated, and you have
                browsed to a Participating Site, the web browser extension will regularly contact the contest servers to
                provide the contest functionality.</p>

            <p>It is therefore possible, when you have activated the web browser extension, that the name of some web
                sites that you visit may be communicated to the contest servers, for the purpose of determining whether
                you have visited a Participating Site. &nbsp;This information will not be collected separately, but may
                be stored in operational logs of the contest servers, and may be used for the purpose of providing The
                Ball Services. &nbsp;If at any time you do not wish to have information communicated to TopCoder&rsquo;s
                contest servers, you should deactivate the web browser extension.&nbsp; </p>

            <p> In addition, when you have activated the web browser extension, detailed information about your activity
                on a Participating Site will be communicated to TopCoder&rsquo;s contest servers, including the pages on
                the Participating Site that you visit, the parts of the pages that you might click or otherwise
                activate, as well as your progress in contests, and this information may be provided to contest sponsors
                and used otherwise to further develop and promote The Ball Services.</p>

        <p><strong>Other Information:</strong></p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong><em>Non-Identifiable Data: </em></strong>When you interact with TopCoder through the Site, we
                receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information. Such information, which is collected
                passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. TopCoder
                may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained
                by TopCoder affiliates, agents or service providers. This Site may use such information and pool it with
                other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of
                visitors to each page of our Site, and the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers. It
                is important to note that no Personal Data is available or used in this process.&nbsp; </p>

            <p> In operating this Site, we may use a technology called &quot;cookies.&quot; A cookie is a piece of
                information that the computer that hosts our Site gives to your browser when you access the Site. Our
                cookies help provide additional functionality to the Site and help us analyze Site usage more
                accurately. For instance, our Site may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Site
                without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Site. In all
                cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission. On most
                web browsers, you will find a &ldquo;help&rdquo; section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section
                for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn
                cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of
                some of the Site&rsquo;s features.</p>

            <p><strong><em>Aggregated Personal Data: </em></strong>In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve
                the users of The Ball Services, TopCoder often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests
                and behavior based on the Personal Data and other information provided to us. This research may be
                compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and TopCoder may share this aggregate data with its
                affiliates, agents and business partners. This aggregate information does not identify you personally.
                TopCoder may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and
                prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.</p>

        <p><strong><u><a name="3" id="3"></a>Our Use of Your Personal Data and Other
            Information</u></strong><strong>:</strong><br/>
            TopCoder uses the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you
            provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason for
            which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by e-mail, we will use the Personal Data you provide
            to answer your question or resolve your problem. Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain
            access to The Ball Services, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access to such services and
            to monitor your use of such services. TopCoder and its subsidiaries and affiliates (the &ldquo;TopCoder
            Related Companies&rdquo;) may also use your Personal Data and other personally non-identifiable information
            collected through the Site to help us improve the content and functionality of the Site, to better
            understand our users and to improve The Ball Services. TopCoder and its affiliates may use this information
            to contact you in the future to tell you about new competitions, news, events, reminders, or other
            information we believe will be of interest to you. If we do so, each communication we send you will contain
            instructions permitting you to &quot;opt-out&quot; of receiving future communications. In addition, if at
            any time you wish not to receive any future communications or you wish to have your name deleted from our
            mailing lists, please contact us as indicated below. We may also use Personal Data to verify your
            eligibility to participate in specific competitions, and to contact you and properly notify the IRS should
            you be a winner. <br/>
            If TopCoder intends on using any Personal Data in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy
            Policy, you will be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the Personal Data is
            collected.</p>

        <p><strong><u><a name="4" id="4"></a>Our Disclosure of Your Personal Data and Other
            Information</u></strong><strong>: </strong><br/>
            TopCoder is not in the business of selling your information. We consider this information to be a vital part
            of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal
            Data with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below: </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or
                assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal
                Data may be part of the transferred assets.&nbsp; </p>

            <p><strong>Related Companies: </strong>We may also share your Personal Data with our Related Companies for
                purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;For example, in certain circumstances,
                TopCoder sponsors will be given access to view your demographic information and contact information.</p>

            <p><strong>Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties:</strong> TopCoder, like many businesses, sometimes
                hires third-parties (i.e., individuals and businesses) to perform certain business-related functions.
                Examples of such functions include mailing information, maintaining databases and processing payments.
                When we employ a third-party to perform a function of this nature, we provide them with the information
                that they need to perform their specific function, and we require them to agree to use that information
                in a manner consistent with this policy.</p>

            <p><strong>Legal Requirements: </strong>TopCoder may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law
                or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii)
                protect and defend the rights or property of TopCoder, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the
                personal safety of users of the Site or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong><u><a name="5" id="5"></a>Your Choices</u></strong><strong>:</strong><br/>
            You can use the Site without providing any Personal Data. If you choose not to provide any Personal Data,
            you may not be able to use certain The Ball Services. </p>

        <p><strong><u><a name="6" id="6"></a>Exclusions</u></strong><strong>:</strong><br/>
            This Privacy Policy does not apply to any Personal Data collected by TopCoder other than Personal Data
            collected through the Site or in connection with The Ball Services. This Privacy Policy shall not apply to
            any unsolicited information you provide to TopCoder through this Site or through any other means. This
            includes, but is not limited to, information posted to any public areas of the Site, such as bulletin boards
            (collectively, &ldquo;Public Areas&rdquo;), any ideas for new products or modifications to existing
            products, and other unsolicited submissions (collectively, &ldquo;Unsolicited Information&rdquo;). All
            Unsolicited Information shall be deemed to be non-confidential and TopCoder shall be free to reproduce, use,
            disclose, and distribute such Unsolicited Information to others without limitation or
            attribution.<strong><u> </u></strong></p>

        <p><strong><u><a name="7" id="7"></a>Children</u></strong><strong>:</strong><br/>
            TopCoder does not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 13. If you are under the
            age of 13, please do not submit any Personal Data through the Site. We encourage parents and legal guardians
            to monitor their children&rsquo;s Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their
            children never to provide Personal Data on this Site without their permission. If you have reason to believe
            that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Data to TopCoder through this Site, please contact
            us, and we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases. </p>

        <p><strong><u><a name="8" id="8"></a>Links to Other Web Sites:</u></strong><br/>
            This Privacy Policy applies only to the Site. This Site may contain links to other web sites not operated or
            controlled by TopCoder (the &ldquo;Third Party Sites&rdquo;). The policies and procedures we described here
            do not apply to the Third Party Sites. The links from this Site do not imply that TopCoder endorses or has
            reviewed the Third Party Sites. We suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy
            policies. </p>

        <p><strong><u><a name="9" id="9"></a>Security:</u></strong><br/>
            TopCoder takes reasonable steps to protect the Personal Data provided via the Site from loss, misuse, and
            unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet or e-mail transmission is
            ever fully secure or error free. In particular, e-mail sent to or from this Site may not be secure.
            Therefore, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail. Please keep
            this in mind when disclosing any Personal Data to TopCoder via the Internet.
        </p>

        <p>The Site also has forum-style discussion topics and other member communication features available to our
            members and sponsors. These forums will identify The Ball members by their user handles. Those simply
            viewing the forums may do so without identifying themselves, but those who wish to participate must be
            members or sponsors and must log in to prove it. Please remember that any information you disclose in these
            areas becomes public information. Accordingly, you should always exercise caution when deciding to disclose
            any personal information. </p>

        <p><strong><u><a name="10" id="10"></a>Other Terms and Conditions:</u></strong><br/>
            Your access to and use of the Site is subject to the Terms of Use. </p>

            The Site and our business may change from time to time. As a result, at times it may be necessary for
            TopCoder to make changes to this Privacy Policy. TopCoder reserves the right to update or modify this
            Privacy Policy at any time and from time to time without prior notice. Please review this policy
            periodically, and especially before you provide any Personal Data. This Privacy Policy was last updated on
            the date indicated above. Your continued use of the Site after any changes or revisions to this Privacy
            Policy shall indicate your agreement with the terms of such revised Privacy Policy. </p>
