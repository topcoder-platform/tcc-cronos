            No purchase necessary to enter or win. Void where prohibited.
            <br/>
            <h3>OVERVIEW</h3><br/>
            These Official Rules govern all TopCoder, Inc. ('TopCoder') 'The
            Ball' competitions (the 'Competitions'). Each individual
            Competition, however, will include additional rules and regulations
            that govern each specific Competition. Registered players will be
            bound by both these Official Rules along with the specific rules
            posted for each particular Competition as well as TopCoder's
            <a href="${ctx}/public/registration.jsp?phase=start&nextPhase=step1">Terms and Conditions</a> (as discussed
            below) and
            <a href="${ctx}/public/privacy-policy.jsp">privacy policy</a>. <br/>
            <br/>
            The Competitions are online scavenger hunts that require players to
            track a virtual ball from Web site to Web site, collecting
            information on the way that may help them 'unlock' the ball and
            achieve victory.<br/>
            <h3>Eligibility</h3><br/>
            Each competition is open to all individuals who are at least 18
            years of age as of the start date of the Competition. <br/>
            <br/>
            All eligible competitors must be registered players ('Players') of
            the Competition, and must have agreed to these Official Rules, the
            Terms and Conditions and any rules and regulations pertaining to a
            particular Competition, by the date set forth in the rules and
            regulations of that Competition. <br/>
            <br/>
            The Competition is void in the Quebec province of Canada and
            elsewhere where prohibited by applicable law. Cash prizes will not
            be paid to residents of Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan,
            or Syria.<br/>
            <br/>
            Employees of TopCoder and those involved in the development,
            production implementation and distribution of Competitions
            (including prize suppliers and sponsors), and their advertising or
            promotion agencies, parent companies, service providers, agents,
            officers, subsidiaries or affiliates, or any other persons or
            entities directly associated with the Competitions and members of
            the immediate families and/or persons living in the same household
            as such persons, are ineligible to compete in any Competition.<br/>
            <br/>
            <h3>CONDITIONS OF PARTICIPATION</h3><br/>
            By participating in the Competition as a Player, you agree to be
            bound by these Official Rules, the Terms and Conditions of Use of
            the TopCoder website (incorporated herein) [Link to Terms and
            Conditions of Use], the rules and regulations specific to a
            particular Competition, and all decisions of TopCoder, which are
            final, binding and conclusive in all matters.<br/>
            <br/>
            Players must interact directly with their web browsers and any
            Competition software provided to a Player. A player may not use
            automated tools or other software or hardware devices to control or
            subvert any web browser or Competition software. All strategies must
            be the Player's alone. Any manner of cheating by Players
            participating in a Competition is strictly prohibited. Any Player
            that does not adhere to these conditions (based solely on TopCoder's
            good faith determination) shall be disqualified from the
            Competition, will forfeit any prize won, and may be disqualified
            from future Competitions. <br/>
            <br/>
            The number of winners and payout percentages for each winner may vary by competition at TopCoder's sole
            discretion. Please refer to the information posted for each competition for the specific number of eligible
            winners and payout information for each competition.<br/>
            <br/>
            In general, the first six eligible players to unlock the ball and solve the subsequent puzzle within the
            required time limit will share in the total jackpot for that game according to the following percentages:<br/>
            <br/>
            1st player to complete the competition - 25% of total jackpot<br/>
            2nd player to complete the competition - 20% of total jackpot<br/>
            3rd player to complete the competition - 17.5% of total jackpot<br/>
            4th player to complete the competition - 15% of total jackpot<br/>
            5th player to complete the competition - 12.5% of total jackpot<br/>
            6th player to complete the competition - 10% of total jackpot<br/>
            <br/>
            Prize winners will be notified via e-mail within ten (10) business
            days of the conclusion of the Competition. All prize winners will be
            required to submit certain information to TopCoder in order to claim
            their prize, including but not limited to, the following: (i) an
            Affidavit of Eligibility and Liability and Publicity Release (which
            must be notarized unless a notarization is already on file with
            TopCoder) and (ii) an IRS Form W-9 or W-8BEN, as appropriate, if one
            is not already on file with TopCoder, for tax reporting purposes
            ('Required Documentation'). By completing the Affidavit of
            Eligibility and Liability and Publicity Release, a prize winner (a)
            confirms his/her eligibility to participate in the Competition, (b)
            represents and warrants that he/she has not cheated during the
            Competition and that the strategies he/she employed in the
            Competition were his/hers alone, (c) verifies the accuracy of the
            demographic information submitted to, and contained in, The Ball
            registration database, (d) authorizes TopCoder to publicize the
            Competition's results, (e) agrees to sign any forms required under
            applicable laws to receive his/her prize, (f) assigns to TopCoder
            the rights to any and all information submitted during the
            Competition, and (g) releases the Released Parties (defined below)
            from any liability arising out of any prize won. If prize
            notification is returned to TopCoder as undeliverable, or if the
            prize winner fails to return the Required Documentation within
            thirty 30 days following the conclusion of the Competition, the
            prize winner will be disqualified from the Competition and forfeit
            the prize won. Providing false information in the registration
            process or in the Required Documentation described in this paragraph
            will disqualify a prize winner and result in forfeiture of the
            prize. <br/>
            <br/>
            Only the prizes listed will be awarded at the completion of a Competition. No
            substitution or transfer of a prize is permitted, except with a
            sponsor's or TopCoder's permission or where required by law. Upon
            the completion of a Competition, no increases in value, interest or
            any other portfolio amounts shall be paid to a Player. <br/>
            <br/>
            Prizes are not redeemable for cash. Any and all applicable taxes on
            prizes are the sole responsibility of the prize winner. Prizes will
            be distributed within sixty (60) days following TopCoder's
            determination of the Competition winners. Undeliverable prizes will
            be forfeited. <br/>
            <br/>
            <h3>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY/INDEMNITY.</h3><br/>
            TopCoder is not responsible for failed, partial or garbled computer
            transmissions, or for technical failures of any kind, including but
            not limited to electronic malfunction or damage of any network,

            any injury or damage to a Player's or any other person's computer
            related to, or resulting from, participation in or downloading any
            materials from a Competition. TopCoder makes no representations or
            warranties of any kind concerning the safety, appearance or
            performance of any prize. <br/>
            <br/>
            By participating in a Competition, a Player agrees to release,
            discharge, and hold harmless TopCoder, its affiliates, subsidiaries,
            sponsors, advertising and promotion agencies, and prize suppliers,
            and each of their respective directors, officers, employees,

            incidental, consequential or punitive damages arising out of your
            access to and participation in a Competition or the TopCoder website

            advised of the possibility of such damages. Certain jurisdictions do
            not allow for the exclusion or limitation of liability, and thus the
            above limitation may not apply to you. Players should check their
            local law for any restrictions or limitations regarding these
            limitations or exclusions.<br/>

            Competitions, and to use the statements made by, or attributed to,
            the winners relating to TopCoder and any and all rights to said use,
            without further compensation. Furthermore, all prize winners agree
            to promptly notify TopCoder if a third-party, including a
            Competition sponsor, contacts the prize winner regarding media
            interest as a result of the prize winner's participation in the
            Competition.<br/>
            <br/>
            TopCoder, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to disqualify
