Reviewer's tests I've changed:

1. I've modified the tests of the accuracy, as the accuracy tester did not clear the configManager after
   his testing. So there are still some configure remains in, and will cause conflicts to the other
   reviewers tests.
   I only add some tearDown method to some classes of the accuracy.

2. Modify the DBProjectRetrievalAccuracyTest#testRetrieveProjectLong_Accuracy2, 
   change "assertEquals("The forum id should be the same.", 0, project.getForumId());"
   to "assertEquals("The forum id should be the same.", -1, project.getForumId());"
   as if the forum id not exists, the forumId field would remain as -1.

3. DBProjectRetrievalStressTest#testRetrieveProjectsByIDs,
   change "if (projects[i].getId() < Helper.COMPONENT_ID_START + DATA_COUNT / 2)"
   to "if (projects[i].getId() < Helper.COMP_VERS_ID_START + DATA_COUNT / 2)"
   This must be a typo here.
