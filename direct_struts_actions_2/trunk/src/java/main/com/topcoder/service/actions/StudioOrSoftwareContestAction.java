 * This is the base class for the actions which must decide if a studio or a software contest is managed based
 * on the project or contest ID. It contains the common logic. It extends <code>ContestAction</code>.

 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Thread safety:</b> In Struts 2 framework the action is constructed for every request so the thread
 * safety is not required (instead in Struts 1 the thread safety is required because the action instances are
 * reused). This class is mutable and stateful, so it's not thread safe.
