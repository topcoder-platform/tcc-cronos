=====================================================
Setup:

- Follow the required steps to test the component in section 4.1 of the CS (in docs folder),
  as it has all the instructions you need to setup your environment and run the tests/demo.

- Mock code for dependencies is in test_files\mock.

=====================================================
Design Improvements/Changes:

- Designer said ARS takes precendence over design notes regarding validations.

  You can get ARS from development phase documents forum.

- Note for csc validation, min length is 3 (http://forums.topcoder.com/?module=Thread&threadID=669914&start=0)
  and max is 4 since only American Express can have 4 and all other valid card types must be 3.

- Some classes were removed: http://forums.topcoder.com/?module=Thread&threadID=669727&start=0
  I have updated CS dependencies section 2.2 to include dependency on Direct Struts Actions 1.0.

- Note the change in implementation for GetDocumentFileContestAction#performLogic
  http://forums.topcoder.com/?module=Thread&threadID=669791&start=15&mc=32

- GetDocumentsContestAction#performLogic/GetDocumentFileContestAction#performLogic was changed to take List<?>
  as parameter instead of List<Object> (http://forums.topcoder.com/?module=Thread&threadID=669791&start=0)

- All private fields in MimeTypeRetriever are now static:

- There were a lot of other design changes also, too many to list, please check forum.

- I improved efficiency on validations, because in many places design called for using multiple validators
  (RequiredFieldValidator and StringLengthValidator) but I combined this logic into a single validation
  using FieldExpressionValidator. In other places, validation is done directly in code, and that is also approved.

  Designer: "ok, you can use all validators that you want or if it's not possible with the annotation validators
             you can manage tha validation directly in the code"

- Added extra validation to make sure credit card hasn't expired:
